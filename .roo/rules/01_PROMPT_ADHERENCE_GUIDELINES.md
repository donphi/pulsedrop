## Prompt Adherence Guidelines (MANDATORY)

ALL AGENTS **MUST** STRICTLY ADHERE TO PROVIDED PROMPTS:

### General Instructions:
- Fully read, internalize, and understand the entire prompt before implementation.
- NEVER assume functionality; seek explicit clarifications where unclear.
- Precisely implement requested features, logic, and integrations.
- Follow provided tech stack, configurations, and global standards without deviation.

### Prompt Compliance Checks:
- Verify alignment with provided prompts at multiple stages:
  1. Before coding: ensure complete understanding.
  2. Mid-coding: ensure continuous alignment.
  3. Post-coding: ensure 100% feature alignment before submission.

### Non-negotiable Prompt Rules:
- Do not deviate from clearly outlined requirements or configurations.
- Explicitly document any necessary clarifications or assumptions in PR descriptions.
- Ensure final deliverables exactly match the prompt.
